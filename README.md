# Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network primarily used for analyzing visual data, such as images and videos. CNNs are well-suited for tasks like image recognition, object detection, and image classification. They use principles from linear algebra, particularly convolution operations, to extract features and identify patterns within images. The architecture of CNNs is inspired by the connectivity patterns of the human brain, particularly the visual cortex, allowing them to efficiently interpret visual information. CNNs consist of layers such as the convolution layer, ReLU layer, pooling layer, and fully connected layer, which work together to extract valuable features from the input data. Unlike traditional neural networks, CNNs can process entire images at once, making them highly effective for computer vision tasks. While CNNs are commonly used for visual data, they can also be adapted to work with audio and other signal data.
